# High-Intensity Interval Training timer - React Native.

# What is High-Intensity Interval Training?

Strategic, high-intensity workouts are often cited in the research on efficient exercise. This type of regimen, known as "high-intensity interval training" is an off-shoot of "standard interval training" originally used to improve the performance of track athletes. The purpose of the exercises is to elevate your hearth rate for a period of time, followed by a period of recovery time. This cycle is reapeted for a number of times (usually 10 repetitions). 

High-Intensity Interval Training elevates your hearth rate to about 90% of maximum capacity, but for a shorter period of time than standard interval training. Recovery time is usually either at full rest or at an intensity around 70% of maximum hearth rate. 

Interval training and high-intensity interval training programs are alternatives to long-duration, low-intensity aerobic training, which has long been embraced by the fitness crowd.

# How to use this app

Once the Start button is pressed, the app will cycle through a series of countdown timers that will alternate between "workout" timer (30s) and "rest" timer (10s). Each High-Intensity Interval Training consists of 10 repetitions followed by a final 30s "rest" countdown. Several high-interval training cycles can be chained together, a typical training session consisting of 2 to 3 cycles.
